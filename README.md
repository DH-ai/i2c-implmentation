## i2c-implmentation

My take on i2c communication to learn about embedded communication in detail. 

### Objectives

1. [ ] Learning about i2c communication{ **Resources:** [Arduino site](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13493/how-do-you-send-data-via-i2c-without-the-wire-library) : [Inner working of i2c](http://www.gammon.com.au/i2c) : [A basic guid to i2c](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbaa565/sbaa565.pdf?ts=1728619959168&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)} 
2. [ ] Implmenting basic i2c between some sensors 
3. [ ] Improving upon the code for more robustness
4. [ ] Some more objectives
